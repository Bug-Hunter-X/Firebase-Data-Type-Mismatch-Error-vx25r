The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the data you are trying to access is not in the expected format. For example, if you are expecting a string but receive a number, or if you are expecting an array but receive an object. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes in your application.  Here's a code example in Javascript showing the error:

```javascript
const snapshot = await db.collection('myCollection').doc('myDoc').get();
const myData = snapshot.data();
console.log(myData.myString); //Error if myString is not a string
```
